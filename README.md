Churn Prediction AI Project

A full-stack machine learning project that predicts customer churn using classical ML, deep learning, and model explainability (SHAP). The system is end-to-end, with deployment via Flask API and Docker containerization, and integrated tools including MLflow, PostgreSQL, and cloud support (AWS/GCP/Azure).

1. Project Overview

This project aims to:

Predict customer churn using various ML models

Compare performance using MLflow

Explain model predictions with SHAP

Serve predictions through a RESTful Flask API

Deploy in Docker containers, optionally on cloud platforms

Store and retrieve data using PostgreSQL (hosted on AWS RDS)

2. Features & Tools

Machine Learning:

Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM

Keras-based deep learning models

PyTorch neural networks

Hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV)

Model evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall, F1, ROC-AUC)

Visual plots: Confusion matrix, ROC curve, SHAP

MLOps:

MLflow: Experiment tracking, model registry, artifact logging

SHAP: Model interpretability (summary, waterfall, force plots)

PDF Reports: Auto-generated with performance summary and visuals

Deployment:

Flask API to serve models

Docker for containerization

PostgreSQL for relational data management

AWS RDS for cloud-hosted database

Google Colab / GCP / Azure for training and experimentation
